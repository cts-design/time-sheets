###Important Branches


```
staging
```
The staging branch is used specifically for merging development branches and testing them on [staging](http://staging.atlasforworkforce.com.). NEVER merge staging into master. We avoid this because staging can potentially have broken code and we want to keep the master branch as clean as possible.
